### Understanding the Categories:

**Bull words**
This word collection is called bull words because, from a financial standpoint, they are considered to have positive connotations. These words are typically associated with upward market trends, increasing stock prices, and overall economic growth. In this sense, bull words are viewed as desirable and are often used by financial analysts and investors to convey optimism about the state of the economy.

**Bear words**
Bear word list is the opposite of positive sentimental words in financial sentiment analysis. For the purpose of evaluating the sentiment around business news, every phrase on this list is regarded as having a contradictory sentiment. Bear word lists typically consist of words that are associated with downward trends in the stock market, such as recession, inflation, unemployment, and bankruptcy.

**Negative words**
Negative word list has words like ‚Äú‡¶®‡¶º‡¶æ‚Äù, ‚Äú‡¶®‡ßü‚Äù, and ‚Äú‡¶®‡ßá‡¶á‚Äù which can make a full sentence negative in the Bangla language. These negative words can have a significant impact on the overall sentiment of a sentence, even if the other words in the sentence are positive. The negative word list is a crucial tool for sentiment analysis in the Bangla language.

**Coordinating conjunction words (Co con.)**
In the Bangla language conjunctions like ‚Äú‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÅ‚Äù, ‚Äú‡¶Ü‡¶¶‡¶™‡ßá‚Äù, ‚Äú‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç‚Äù, ‚Äú‡¶Ö‡¶•‡¶¨‡¶æ‚Äù plays an important role in sentence making. They should have their own weighted effect value in sentiment analysis. By assigning weighted effect values to conjunctions in Bangla language, resulting in more accurate sentiment analysis.

**Subordinating conjunctions (Sub con.)**
Another kind of conjunctions list with words like "‡¶Ö‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§", "‡¶è‡¶Æ‡¶®‡¶ï‡¶ø", "‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∑‡¶§". These conjunctions are often used to indicate a shift in tone or emphasis in a sentence and can play a significant role in shaping the overall sentiment. By assigning weighted effect values to these conjunctions, financial analysts can further refine their sentiment analysis, providing even more accurate insights into the sentiment of financial news and information.

**Adjectives and adverbs (Adj.)**
We listed some adjectives and adverbs like "‡¶∏‡¶¨‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶§‡ßá", "‡¶Ö‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï", "‡¶∏‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï" as they are used to glorify the sentence sentiment more than other simple words. We categorized them into 3 weighted categories: high, medium, and low. Words with high weight have the greatest impact, words with medium weight have a moderate impact, and words with low weight have the least impact.
